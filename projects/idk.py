# idk what to name this file ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­, but yeah, it's basically asking for your name and matching it to the original input i have given it.

realName = "ABCDE"
realPassword = "password132"

print("Enter Username")
name = (input())

print("Enter Password")
password = (input())

if realName == name and realPassword == password:
  print("You have logged in")
else:
  print("Wrong Username or Password")
